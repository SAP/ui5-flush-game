Flush! is an innovation project that brings together Web app capabilities of OpenUI5 with open source game and effect frameworks:

* [OpenUI5](https://github.com/SAP/openui5) (app and game mechanics)
* [CreateJS](https://createjs.com/) (canvas rendering, sound, animations)
* [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) (physics)
* [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) (UI5 control to canvas mapping)

We leverage the enterprise-grade UI5 technology with custom controls, custom theming, sprite effects, game mechanics, and scripted levels to create a unique browser game.
